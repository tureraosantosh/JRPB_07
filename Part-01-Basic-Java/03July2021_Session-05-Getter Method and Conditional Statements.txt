Operator  : A Symbol which perform operation on operand (value) it is called operator.

types of Operator:
   1) Unary(One)  : which operator perform operation on single value(Oprand) that operator called Unary.
      a)increment
	  
	   b=10;
		b++
	    
	  b)decrement
	   a=10;
		 a--;
	   
   2) Binary(Two) : Which Operator perform operation on two value(Operand) that operator called Binary.
                 a)Arithmatic operator.
                             +,-,/,%
                           x=5;
							y=90;
							z=x+y;
				b)Logical
				
				1)And 2)or 3) Not.
				
				c)Compare : it return always true or false 
				    1)greater >
					2)less <
					3)>=  5>8
					4)<=
					5)==
					
					10==107
					100>10
					100<10
				d)Assigment 
				   a=5;
				   b=0;			
				   
				   z=a>b;
				   
				   
				   
  3)Ternary (Three): which operator perform operation on three or more values called ternary operator.
               example:
			   ?:

Data  Type:

primitive :

		Number
		 int
		 double
		 Long
		 
		 Charactor
		 
		    char divisio='A'
			char name='s'
			String name="santosh"
					boolean 
Statement :
        
		combination of variable constants.
		1)declaration : where we declare variable,method,class etc called declaration statement.
		
		   int a;
		 2)arithmatic : mathemitc 
		 x+y;
		 
		3) conditional statment:
		  1)Jumping                    2)Looping
		    if,else if                    for,while,do-while.
			switch case               
		
		

public static void main(String[] args) {
		int mark;
		mark = 5;

		if (mark > 40) {
			System.out.println("You Are Passed");
		} else {
			System.out.println("You are Eligible to Enjoy one more Year !!!!");
		}

	}
	Assigment
	if age greater than 18 You are eligble for voting.
	else : you are not eligble for voting.
	
	2. if age greater than 45 You are eligble for Vaccine
